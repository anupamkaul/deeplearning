These are from the book "GANs by David Foster" (O Rielly)

GANs : generational networks (generate X dataset using Pmodel to estimate Pdata)

Pg 27 : how to set up (done : keras, tf, "generative" env)

Pg 35 : your first dnn : loading the CIFAR-10 dataset 
        (a collection of 60K 32 * 32 pixel color images 
         bundled with Keras : each image is classified 
         into 1 of 10 classes)
