Exploring variational auto-encoders
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf)

Let's first build a standard autoencoder and then
a variational ae. VAEs are fundamental to building
GANs. I will also highlight / pick apart both
AEs and VAEs to understand how to build & manipulate
autoencoder models an in particular VAEs from scratch
to generate images (GANs) from my own training set.

The first example follows from the N.Coder and D.Coder 
actors described in pages 61 - 66 in Generative Deep Learning
